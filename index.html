					## Examples of #h5is<
					
					The different kinds of "sucking"
					- just starting out: knowing that you don't know things is infinitely more useful than believing you know everything. h5is and the illusion of explanatory depth.
					- making a mistake: shit happens, we're all in the same boat. some days it's an orchestra, some days it's a 7 year old learning to play the violin. It's good to know you're not alone.
					- not having time/resources to complete a project/task: h5is and the practice of strategic incompetence
					- not being brave enough to share or ask for feedback on ideas/wip: h5is and shared intentionality

					<aside class="notes">
						Oh hey, these are some notes. They'll be hidden in your presentation, but you can see them if you open the speaker notes window (hit 's' on your keyboard).

					## So why is it good?

					- allows people to show things not finished or working
					- is designed to be a "safe space"
					- doesn't need to be useful! get creative :)
					- doesn't need to be code or a jist, could just be an idea or a series of thoughts
					- highlight is not so much on "being awesome" as it is on learning and pushing forwards/persevering
					- low bar to entry
					- encourages creativity
					- when people are able to explore/create anything will get a greater variety of ideas (genetic algorithms - fake optimisation)
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## So why is it hard?

					- perfectionism
					- inner critic
					- feeling like there's no niche or nothing that's going to be helpful
					- lack of creativity
					- lack of confidence
					- low self-esteem
					- fear of judgement
					- fear of failure
					- fear of silence!
					- no time to create
					- no-one to create with
					- no foothold within the community
				</section>
				<section data-markdown>
					## Methods

					- the rose, the thorn and the bud
					- celebrating ambition/creativity regardless of project outcome
					- essentially lower the stakes of failure
					- fail better

					<h2>failure is temporary, success is forever.</h2>
					<p>Umbraco already have a unique, friendly community spirit, so why not use to foster creativity everywhere?</p>
