						<p>My degree was in CS & AI, and when I was at uni I became fascinated by how technology can be used to model an individual's understanding of a problem space and then use that information for e.g. game mechanics, ALEs</p>
						<p>AI is a 2-way street. Using human intelligence as a benchmark for artificial intelligence. Using machines to better understand the brain: fMRIs, eye-tracking, cognitive modelling & ALEs</p>
						<p>Perfect feedback loop, right? ...</p>
						<p>And really, why wouldn't you be interested in the brain? My ambitions of being an astronaut, ballerina, olympic gymnast have fallen by the wayside - so I make a living with my brain</p>

						<h3>What is the impact of sleep deprivation?</h3>
						<p>Ever tried to teach a tired child anything?</p>
						<p>Push and pull between amygdala (anger, irritability, anxiety, fear) and neocortex (consciousness, attention, perception, reasoning)</p>
						<p>Won't be surprised to learn that memory, manual dexterity & complex decision making are the first affected brain regions - parts of the brain actually fall asleep at different times</p>
						<p>Mitochondria are tiny structure that fuel the body by producing molecules called <b>adenosine triphosphate</b> or ATP...</p>
						<p>Long term effects of lack of sleep involve raised bood pressure/heart problems, but short term sleep deprivation can impact on our memories</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>David Eagleman references a study that attempted to teach retrograde amnesiacs how to play tetris.</p>
						<p>SW sleep preserves our memories by recapitulating what we have learned during the day. REM incorporates these memories into what we already know.</p>
						<p>...we still don't fully understand the reasons/implications of sleep - elephants 4 hrs, big cats 15 hrs, humans 8 hrs, brown bat 19 hrs</p>
						<p>But we know it plays a number of key roles, and without it your brain will struggle to fully function!</p>

					<h2 class="abs-float invert">The wandering mind</h2>
					<img src="/images/wandering.jpeg" />

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I find that when I am struggling with a problem not only is it energy consuming, but one of the side-effects is lack of focus or "mind-wandering"</p>
						<p>Your mind is like a town - when focused everyone is in the town square but when wandering, activity is distributed. Default mode network.</p>
						<p>Benefits of mindfulness are well documented. + shrunken amygdala + enlarged prefrontal cortex. During mind wandering, subjects report less happy than not.</p>
						<p><b>Ever daydreamed through a green light or asked someone for the time only to have zoned out by the time they tell you the answer? So why do we do it and how could it help?</b></p>
						<p>Advantages of mind wandering include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>attentional cycling - honing mental juggling skills - working on different problems simultaneously</li>
							<li>dishabituation - refreshed attention, brain responds to change - change of mental scenery</li>
							<li>relief from boredom - ability to persevere with tedious but necessary tasks</li>
							<li>also, problem incubation - where your brain is able to work asynchronously on a problem without direct input from your consciousness</li>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>In order to explore the potential impact of mind wandering on creative problem solving, Baird & Smallwood conducted a study involving Unusual Use Tasks</p>
						<p>Their hypothesis was that tasks without a working memory load elicits more mind wandering than tasks with a working memory load... </p>
						<p>pencil - chopstick, lock pick, javelin, rolling pin, </p>
						<p>Problem incubation where freeing up your working memory allows it to work unhindered and autonomously on the problem that the conscious brain provided it.</p>

					</div>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>All forms of voluntary attention and effort (cognitive, emotional & physical) draw at least partly on a pool of shared mental energy</p>
						<p>Successive tasks where you force yourself to do something mean that you become increasingly unwilling to exert additional self-control</p>
						<p>This phenomenon is called <b>ego depletion</b></p>
						<p>Situations that deplete you are varied but generally involve conflict and the need to suppress a natural tendency</p>
						<ul>
							<li>e.g. responding kindly to bad behaviour or suppressing a natural emotional response - maybe in the work place</li>
							<li>e.g. making a series of choices each of which involve conflict e.g. choosing what to have for lunch ;)</li>
							<li>e.g. trying to impress people - suppressing your personality, overriding your own emotions</li>
						</ul>
						<p>The nervous system consumes more glucose than most other parts of the body, and effortful mental activity appears to especially expensive in the currency of glucose</p>
						<p>The cake is not a lie</p>
